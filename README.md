## Getting Started

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more
[in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It
provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks &
generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for
Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will
be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you
might want to go a step further.
